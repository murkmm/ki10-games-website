Welcome back to the Ki10 Games devlog!

This week has been all about populating the world with wildlife and terrain, focusing mainly on grass and rocks to start with before moving onto ground textures, trees, plants, etc. I’ve been experimenting with different methods of creating these rocks and grass features, focusing on not only how they look but the optimisation side of things too.

### **Rock My World**

When experimenting with rock assets, it has been really important that I stay loyal to the initial inspirations for our art style: **Crash Bandicoot 4: It’s About Time** and **Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy**.

However, it's equally important that we don't just create a clone of the assets used in those games. Capturing the smooth, almost toon-like surfaces and textures while creating our own unique look was a high priority.

From modelling these rocks by hand to incorporating modifiers into the models, I eventually found a design that felt right! I'm happy with the outcome as it fits right into the style we envisioned from the beginning.

  <figcaption class="mt-2 text-center text-sm italic text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">A very rocky rock.</figcaption>
</figure>

### **Don’t Be A Grass!**

Alongside the rocks, I’ve been experimenting with different methods of creating **grass** for our game world.

I've tested several approaches, including:

1.  Creating grass purely using **Unity's built-in features**.
2.  Importing individual grass models created in **Blender**.
3.  Making use of **Geometry Nodes in Blender** to generate whole beds of grass at once.

It’s been fun learning all of these different approaches and exploring which method would work best for the player experience! With the grass, it has been really important to not only bring environments to life with beautiful styles but to also ensure the game is **well optimised** and not sacrificing things like framerate for the sake of having something pretty to look at!

Thanks for reading about rocks and grass,
