Hey everyone, and welcome to the first official post from Ki10 Games.

We are Mark and Scott, two best friends from the UK who have been mad about gaming and all things nerdy since we were kids. This is the story of how we finally decided to build our dream game together.

For years, I (Mark) have worked in the games industry but always in a QA capacity, testing amazing games made by other people. The dream of creating my own was always there. Scott, a school teacher by day, shared that same passion, constantly gaming, drawing and teaching himself game development in his spare time.

We finally decided to join forces and so Ki10 Games was born.

### The Story of the Name

The name (pronounced Kitten or K-I-10, take your pick!) comes from a few places that are really important to us. We started with a joke that our goal was just to sell 10 copies. It was our way of taking the pressure off, to remind ourselves that we’re not here to make millions, we’re here because we love the process and we love making games together. That joke became our genuine goal and a part of our identity.

The name is also a tribute to Scott's son, Kit, who is a huge inspiration for the worlds we want to build. Our game's hero is even named after him: **KIT - Knight in Training**. And of course, there’s my lifelong love of cats. The name sounds like 'kitten', and my two 6 month old kittens, King Arthur and Sir Lancelot, are constant fluffy reminders of the Knights of the Round Table theme in our game.

### A New Motivation

Our journey took an unexpected turn last year. Development on our first idea was cut short when Scott was hospitalised with a serious chronic illness. It was a terrifying time and honestly, I didn't know if he was going to make it. For him, not to being able to do what he loved was heartbreaking.

Thankfully, he's on the mend now, but that experience lit a fire under us. It was a stark reminder that life is too short not to chase the things you're passionate about. We couldn't bear the thought of Ki10 having never released a game. So, once Scott had recovered enough, we put our heads together to create something that truly meant the world to us.

### Introducing: KIT - Knight in Training

That’s how **KIT – Knight in Training** came to be. We both grew up loving 3D platformers. My first ever game was Crash Bandicoot and Scott has a deep love for the Jak and Daxter series. So we asked ourselves: What if we blended the tight, corridor-style platforming of Crash with the more open, explorable areas of Jak and Daxter?

From May 2025 until present, we've been plugging away at building this world themed around cats as the Knights of the Round Table. And now, we feel it’s the perfect time to stop building in the dark and start building a community. We want to share this journey with you, the good, the bad and everything in between. Our website is a work in progress, just like our game, and we’ll be updating it as we go.
