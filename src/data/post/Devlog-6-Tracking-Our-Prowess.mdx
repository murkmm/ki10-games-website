Welcome back to the Ki10 Games devlog!

This week has been all about implementing core gameplay and quality of life systems. Specifically, I've been focused on bringing a functional **Map and Quest Log system** into the game to help players navigate the world and track their progress.

### **Hunting for Paw Prints of Prowess**

Our main collectible, the **Paw Prints of Prowess** (still a placeholder name and model, but we love the alliteration!), is what drives exploration in our levels. To make the pursuit of these collectibles fun and manageable, we needed a system to help players track them without just handing everything over.

This new system handles several key functions:

1.  **Vague Location Tracking:** The map will show a general area where the uncollected Paw Prints can be found. We want to encourage exploration, not just waypoint following, so it’s intentionally broad.
2.  **A Helpful Nudge:** Each Paw Print will now have a **hint** attached to it in the quest log. This is a small piece of environmental or puzzle solving information to get the player started on collecting it.
3.  **Collection Log:** Once collected, the Paw Print is marked as complete in the log, letting you see exactly what you’ve accomplished in that area.
4.  **Quick Revisit:** A feature I'm particularly happy with is the ability to **teleport** back to the general area where a Paw Print was collected. This makes it easier to jump back into a favorite location or revisit a level to find an item you missed.

Building out this system from the UI design for the log to the code that handles the map markers and teleportation was a major push, but it feels like a massive leap forward for the game's structure!

### **A Proper Outfit for our Knight**

In other news, our protagonist, **Kit**, has had a wardrobe change! For a while, we’ve been using a simple, robot model as a placeholder while Scott worked on KIT's design of our hero.

I've finally completed the swap, and Kit’s **proper model** is now implemented in the game, it's not quite there yet and needs more work but it’s a huge morale boost to see the character we've been designing finally running around in the levels, it really helps the game start to feel _real_. Seeing the character art come to life is a massive win and gives us a great sense of direction for the levels and enemies to come.

Thanks for reading and see you next time,
